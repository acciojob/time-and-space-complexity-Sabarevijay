	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial aspect of algorithm analysis that measures how the execution time of an algorithm grows as input size increases. A well-designed algorithm should have an efficient time complexity to ensure optimal performance.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires in relation to the input size. For example, an algorithm with a space requirement of O(n) grows linearly with the input size, meaning it requires additional memory for each new element.</p>
